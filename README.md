## Raspberry pi dog robot running Ros operating sistem programming
The final script found in lab6.py, makes the robot follow this instructions:

If the robot “sees” an object of the specified color (ex: red, green, or blue), advance until within 10-20 cm from the object, 
then switch to close-range tracking where the robot will change its pitch (up-down axis) to keep the object in the center of the camera
